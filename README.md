## Cover automation

My personal cover automation blueprint.

Based on [Cover Control Automation (CCA)](https://github.com/hvorragend/ha-blueprints/tree/main) ([license](https://github.com/hvorragend/ha-blueprints/blob/main/LICENSE)) of [hvorragend](https://github.com/hvorragend). I initially choose a different, time-triggered way to automate my covers until i found CCA. To learn more about blueprints i tried to combine both with most of it being based on CCA.
